Khajiit mostly stay on land, but piracy and Skooma trade does draw some to work as sailors.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Khajiit anatomy differs greatly from both men and elves, not only because of their fur, tail, and sometimes toe-walking stance, but also their digestive system and metabolism. Khajiit, Argonians, and Imga are the so-called \"beast races\" of Tamriel because of these large differences. Khajiit have a lifespan similar to that of humans. There are no well-documented cases of cross-breeding between Khajiit and other races, though there are rumors of such a thing. The foreign appearance and behavior of Khajiit make them common targets of racial discrimination, being given the name Cat-Men by foreigners, which the Khajiit don't take lightly to.</p>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Khajiit very widely, even amongst themselves. Each khajiit experiences their own morphology based upon the positions of Masser and Secunda, and as such, have drastically different forms. There are seventeen different forms one khajiit could be born to, however most follow a similar styling. They all have some amount of fur, and cat-like eyes. Heights range widely from that of a house cat to well over 7 feet tall. Khajiit have lifespans closer to the human races, ranging between 70 to 80 years.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Engage in some form of merchantry</li>\n<li>Consume moon sugar, as well as other strange substances</li>\n<li>Meditate deeply on your actions before taking them</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume you are a thief</li>\n<li>Think of you as a lesser race</li>\n<li>Believe you are addicted to skooma</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>The Mane, while the unofficial head-of-state, is no more a \"breed\" of Khajiit than any other is; they are simply unique. Khajiit tradition holds that only one Mane may be alive at any one time since the Mane is one entity reborn in different bodies with the passage of time. The veracity of this is unknown, but there has been no recorded instance of multiple Manes contending for power. The Khajiit are divided by two disparate ways of life: the civilized jungles and river basins of southern Elsweyr, which have ancient mercantile traditions, a stable agrarian aristocracy based on the exportation of saltrice and Moon Sugar, and a thriving artistic culture, which contrasts greatly with the nomadic tribe or pride-centric Khajiit of the dry northern wastes and grasslands, where aggressive and territorial raiders occasionally unite under a single chieftain. It is widely held that the greatest force among the Khajiit are the Clan Mothers. It is they, ultimately, who control both the harvest and refining of Moon Sugar, and thus they who are seen as the most influential. Over the years, Khajiit frequently have had to deal with the worry of being kidnapped and sold into slavery, especially from Morrowind.</p>\n<p>The Khajiit often refer to Moon Sugar as \"crystallized moonlight\", trapped by the glimmering waters of the Topal Sea and washed to the sugarcane groves of the Tenmar Forest by the tides, under the guidance of Hermorah. The Khajiit believe that by consuming it, they are consuming a small portion of the eternal souls of the moon gods, Jone and Jode. It drives them into fits of ecstasy and abandon, purportedly leaving the streets of Elsweyr's major cities strewn with catmen shivering in the grip of sugar-fits.</p>\n<p>Despite the extremely addictive nature of the sugar, it is an integral part of Khajiit life and the chief export of Elsweyr, where it is smuggled out in both raw and refined forms. It helps support a thriving black market; it is said one can purchase practically anything among the Khajiit. Khajiit of the desert tribes are often buried with only a small cairn of stones, so their bodies can be easily used by necromancers.</p>\n<p>Moon-Singers are known as keepers of the lore and storytellers of ancient tales and legends. Similar to the Bosmeri Spinners, they are well respected among the Khajiit and are primarily found in Elsweyr. Knowledge of some ancient tales, such as the tale of Khunzar-ri and the demons, are split across several Moon-Singers in order to maintain its secrets.</p>\n<p>While the majority of Khajiit prefer to use their razor-sharp and retractable claws as weapons in numerous forms of Khajiiti martial arts like Goutfang, Whispering Fang and Rawlith Khaj, many have mastered the use of the sabre, scimitar, dagger, and longbow. Their chosen mastery is often reflected in male Khajiit names, through which they display their status in life with the prefix; though care is always taken, for the use of two titles is perceived as the result of either great pride or ignorance. While widely speculated, it is unknown whether the Khajiit are in any way related to the Po' Tun (currently Ka Po' Tun) cat people of Akavir or the Lilmothiit, a vulpine beast race which inhabited Black Marsh.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>A monomythic society, the Khajiit are educated in their beliefs by the figures within their communities known as \"Clan Mothers\", whose duty it is to disseminate the cultural myths among their kind, and who maintain autonomy from the Mane and the disparate tribal leaders.</p>\n<p>The Khajiiti pantheon encompasses myriad Aedric and Daedric gods, which are recognized as spirits, a fraction of which are detailed below. Various gods rose and fell out of prominence over the eras due to events and cultural changes. Indeed, after the unification of Anequina and Pellitine into one kingdom, and the event known as the Riddle'Thar Epiphany, the Riddle'Thar cult would rise and scrub many of these spirits from the Khajiit pantheon, and those that refused to follow the new edicts of the Ephiphany faced persecution.</p>\n<p>Prior to the Riddle'Thar replacing the ancient theology of the Khajiit, ancient texts were written by Amun-dro, the Silent Priest, who categorized the spirits as Sky, Worldly, Wandering, Dark, or Adversarial Spirits. Some that hold the modern religious beliefs of the Riddle'Thar consider these writings a blasphemy due to their deference and respect for darker spirits, such as suggesting Azurah walked the realm of Hermorah as a friend. Additionally, they were considered dangerous due to the fact that they were created during the time that Khajiit held scattered beliefs, with sixteen different faiths competing against each other, that \"tumbled and scratched their way through history, competing for the souls of all Khajiit.\" However, this did not stop Khajiit from seeking out the knowledge of the ancient beliefs that had been displaced.</p>\n<p>Featured prominently in a Khajiit's spiritual journey is \"the Path\", a road they take during their journey through life, while avoiding temptations that would lead them astray so they could ultimately reach a sort of enlightment.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To modern Khajiit, this would be the Riddle'Thar theology, and how each Khajiit reaches their fate or place in the universe varies per Khajiit. It can mean finally achieving the right to rule for those of royal blood, or simply perishing. Amun-dro's writings detail the \"Many Paths of time\", where ancient Khajiit looked to their various spirits as a source of guidance (or avoidance) to reach their destinations. There is many examples of how the spirits fulfill a role in the various Paths, whether by aiding or hindering Khajiit during their journey. These Many Paths were created by Akha after he left behind trails as he explored the heavens, and were inherited by Alkosh, who is aided by Khenarthi, who helps him ensure the tapestry of time is mended. Some believe that when the Riddle'Thar replaced the Many Paths with his one true path of the moons, he hid Khajiit from the other viable Paths.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is unsurprising that the most prominent among the spirits was Azurah, the Mother of All Khajiit. She bound the forms and unified the spirits of all Khajiit by tying them to the Lunar Lattice, and thus is the reason why they are not bound to fate, and may instead forge their own futures. Forming a connection with her was the first step on the Path, her \"twilight path\", which is \"the path to love and redemption\". At the end of a Khajiit's Path, they are reunited with Azurah along with the souls of all other Khajiit at the Gates of the Crossing behind the Lunar Lattice, which they will cross to reach the afterlife beyond.</p>\n<p>There were other examples of helpful spirits, such as Mafala who watches over Eight of the Many Paths, and teaches to \"Lust for nothing but Truth.\", Boethra, the patron of warriors and rebellious exiles, and Hircine, who guides Khajiit back to the Path should they get lost. The barrier of going through the Path are the challenges posed by many hostile spirits, a sample which are Sheggorath and his Madness, Sangiin and his Lust without purpose, and most notably Namiira, who is responsible for corrupting Khajiit souls.</p>\n<p>Modern Khajiit hold the virtues given to them by the Riddle'Thar as sacred, which tells how modern khajiit must live. As prophesied by the First Mane of the Epiphany, They must be curious (to avoid Lorkhan's depictions), clever (to navigate the hardships of life), kind (to \"blaze a trail for the downtrodden to follow\"), pious (to avoid Namiira's temptations), and wary (of the other races, as well as the dangers of Oblivion). These virtues, along with some of the spirits that are approved after the Riddle'Thar Epiphany, are detailed in the book, the Secrets of the Riddle'Thar. Some believe that when Riddle'Thar guided Khajiit along his so called one true path of the moons, he hid Khajiit from other viable paths.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Khajiit often turn to a life of crime, typically petty thievery, due to their innate abilities to excel in the dark. Famous and infamous rogues are often khajiit, but some of the leading monks across Tamriel also share the same lineage. Many who choose not to seek adventure often spend their lives peddling goods or traveling the continent. Few pursue the arcane arts, but some have been noted as powerful clergy.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["humanoid","hb_khajiit"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.8,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-11-18T12:04:53.238-08:00","version":{"schema":0.796,"foundry":"10.290","system":"4.4.0"}}},"hp":8,"size":"med","reach":5,"speed":30,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["dex"]},"1":{"value":["wis"]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":["int"]}},"languages":{"value":["common","ta'agra"],"custom":""},"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"value":[],"custom":""},"items":{"kpqpc":{"img":"icons/commodities/claws/claw-canine-brown-grey.webp","name":"Claws","level":0,"uuid":"Item.zAafa534G4Phyt1f"},"p19ua":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/ancestry/low-light-vision.webp","name":"Low-Light Vision","level":0,"uuid":"Item.YOsgxAQP1wEHYaBf"}},"vision":"normal","voluntaryBoosts":{},"voluntaryFlaws":{},"rarity":{"value":"common"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.4.0","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":1668802238350,"modifiedTime":1668802238350,"lastModifiedBy":"vVBkRn7sTCpUhdHE"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"vVBkRn7sTCpUhdHE":3}}
{"_id":"4wjMUCme7Y1W5jho","name":"Orsimer","type":"ancestry","img":"the%20elder%20scrolls/races/LO-race-Orsimer.png","effects":[],"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p><em>The Orsimer, or \"Pariah Folk\" in ancient times, are the elves of the Wrothgarian and Dragontail Mountains, and are found throughout Valenwood, Skyrim, and Orsinium. They are noted for their unshakable courage in war and their unflinching endurance of hardships.&nbsp;</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>In the past, orcs were widely feared and hated by the other nations of Tamriel, and were seen as nothing more than uncivilized beasts. Contrary to traditional stories, the orsimer people are as civilized as any of the other races, having worked hard to be seen as an actual people. They have slowly won acceptance in the Empire, in particular for their distinguished service in the Imperial Legion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Hold yourself to a stern code of conduct</li>\n<li>Devote yourself to a type of craftmanship</li>\n<li>Use your stature to intimidate your enemies</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>See you as uncivilized</li>\n<li>Try to take advantage of your natural strength</li>\n<li>Regard your people as rough and cruel</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Orcs are typically green-skinned, with small tusks protruding up, and are often greater than 6-feet tall with weights ranging from 150 to 250 pounds. They are a strong people built on a society that requires one to constantly prove themselves. Their skin tones range from deep forest greens to faint green-grey palettes. Eye color is typically green in color, but can range in its hue and shade.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Unlike their other elven cousins, orsimer live a rapid life, closer to mankind. They reach maturity around 20 years of age, and live about 80 years. Some orcs have been able to live longer lives, but given their more destructive culture, it is a rarity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>The orcs have considered themselves outcasts like their deity Malacath, and this is reflected in much of their culture. For instance, unlike other races, the orc tradition is to have weddings take place at midnight. Traditional orcish society is centered around stronghold settlements, each one striving for complete independence in all matters. Orc society is based on polygamy - a stronghold's tribe is controlled by a chieftain, who is the literal alpha male: no other males are permitted to take wives or father children. The chieftain is replaced by whichever one of his sons grows strong enough to challenge and kill him. The strength of a tribe (and the favor granted to it by Malacath) depends heavily on the personal strength of the chieftain.</p>\n<p>Orc women are expected to contribute to the strength of the stronghold just as men, as warriors, hunters, or herbalists. Traditionally, the orcish art of smithing is done by the women, and a chieftain's second wife is called the forgewife for this reason. The chieftain&rsquo;s first wife is known as the huntswife and is responsible for patrolling the stronghold and providing the stronghold with game.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other roles for wives include the hearthwife, responsible for more domestic duties in the stronghold and shieldwives, who can serve more as bodyguards to the chieftain. A wise woman handles a tribe's spiritual matters and healing needs. However, orcish society is still very patriarchal. All stronghold women are either the wives or daughters of chieftains, with the exception of the wise women, who are the mothers of chieftains. Daughters of the chieftain are usually traded to other strongholds to marry other chieftains.</p>\n<p>However, many orcs seek to escape traditional life in the strongholds. Orc women may want to escape being \"just another wife\" to the chieftain. They leave to join the Imperial Legion, see the world, or otherwise seek their fortune; some eventually return to the strongholds, but many do not. Orcs who do not live in strongholds are derisively called \"city Orcs\" by those that do, and are considered soft outsiders just like non-Orcs. Given their history of provincial homelessness, frequent military service, and the demand for their craftsmanship, it's not surprising that orcs have traveled all around Tamriel and are now a commonplace sight in cities throughout. Still, orcs who live in the cities with other races are likely to face prejudice. Their appearance makes interbreeding with other races of Tamriel so rare that it is commonly thought impossible.</p>\n<p>Orcs are famed for their skill in smithing, particularly with the metal Orichalcum, which they use to forge armor and weapons. The resulting armaments are heavy and require great endurance to wield, but offer peerless strength and durability. They also work with ebony and have a unique skill in tooling leather for exceptional flexibility and toughness.</p>\n<p>Vosh Ball, also know as \"Courage\" Ball, is a traditional sport played by the orcs where two teams of six are armed with three balls each and throw them at each other until only one side is still standing. Early iterations of the sport used a metal or wooden ball, but they have since been replaced by leather ones. In addition to games, orcs have their own holidays and traditions that they celebrate as well, such as Malacath's Vengeance Day and the annual New Life celebration thrown by the Seamount Clan, the Stonetooth Bash.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>The Code of Malacath</h2>\n<p>The law of the orcs is based on the Code of Malacath, an unwritten law. The Code prohibits things such as theft and unwarranted violence, but also places heavy emphasis on honor and personal strength in resolving conflicts. Orcs do not use imprisonment as punishment: those who violate the code must either pay material compensation or pay a \"blood price\", which entails allowing the one they offended to spill their blood until the price has been satisfied. Some orcs use a scale for weighing out blood price amounts, with different gold weights labeled \"Chief\", \"Wife\", and \"Warrior\". In other cases, some orcs keep detailed a record of all of the grievances and insults their family has suffered, with dates, specifics, and planned responses.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Mainstream orcish religion is fairly unique to Tamriel in that it is monotheistic. Most orcs revere Malacath, the Daedric Prince of Curses. The orthodox belief among Wrothgarian and wood orcs is that Malacath is a broken Trinimac, transformed by Boethiah after he in some way stole the former Champion of Auriel's form. There is debate among orcs on whether he is Malacath, the Daedric outcast of Oblivion, or Mauloch, the Aedric outcast of Aetherius. Some even believe that he is both and has fittingly been cast out by both groups of divines.</p>\n<p>Regardless, after being reborn in his ashy prison, the newly-transformed Malacath cursed Boethiah and created the Code of Malacath, a central tenant to orcish religion. While exact interpretations vary between clans, his main commandments are as follows.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not steal.</li>\n<li>Do not kill your kin.</li>\n<li>Do not attack without cause.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those who break these rules must pay the Blood Price.</p>\n<p>Upon death, followers of Malacath (or Mauloch) believe they will end up in Malacath's realm of the Ashpit. Here, Orcs are promised rewards of immortality, abundant food and drink, and constant battle deep within the Ashen Forge. Lending to the ambiguity of Mauloch's Aedric status, it is said that the Ashpit extends into Aetherius, allowing worthy Orsimer to freely transition into a more traditional afterlife.</p>\n<p>Some fringe members of Orsimer society choose to instead worship Trinimac. Some believe that Trinimac was the one that absorbed power from Boethiah, improving the Orsimer in the process, while other worshippers think that Malacath and Trinimac are actually wholly separate entities, and that Malacath lies to keep them as pariahs under his thumb. The latter belief has briefly risen to prevalence on numerous occasions, typically under newly-crowned kings of Orsinium who sought to form friendly relations with their neighbors, as was the case with King Kurog of Second Orsinium and King Gortwog gro-Nagorm of Nova Orsinium. In both of these cases, the transition to Trinimac worship was brief and controversial, with orcs reverting back to Malacath worship after their deaths.</p>\n<p>The followers of Trinimac believe that when they die, they ascend directly to Aetherius to join with their ancestors. The afterlife of Trinimac's faithful also consists of endless war and celebrations, but with a greater emphasis on once again spending time with family members who came before them.</p>\n<p>Most orcs that follow the Code are typically lawful and more neutrally aligned. However many are more free-spirited and join bands of highwaymen, following the more naturally chaotic nature within.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Most orcs grow to become powerful fighters on the frontlines of the Imperial Legion or back within their stronghold. Those that break or otherwise abandon Malacath's Code go on to join mercenary bands or even bandits as merciless barbarians. Some even find peace in other churches as champions of the Divines.&nbsp;</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["humanoid","orc"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.8,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-11-18T12:04:52.347-08:00","version":{"schema":0.796,"foundry":"10.290","system":"4.4.0"}}},"hp":10,"size":"med","reach":5,"speed":20,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["str"]},"1":{"value":["con"]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":["dex"]}},"languages":{"value":["common","orcish"],"custom":""},"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"value":[],"custom":""},"items":{},"vision":"normal","voluntaryBoosts":{},"voluntaryFlaws":{},"rarity":{"value":"common"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.4.0","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":1668802238350,"modifiedTime":1668802238350,"lastModifiedBy":"vVBkRn7sTCpUhdHE"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"vVBkRn7sTCpUhdHE":3}}
{"_id":"5FBl8ANSFNf3q6yr","name":"Redguard","type":"ancestry","img":"the%20elder%20scrolls/races/LO-race-Redguard.png","effects":[],"flags":{"journal-links":{"references":{}}},"system":{"description":{"value":"<p><em>Redguards are the most naturally talented warriors in Tamriel. The dark-skinned, wiry-haired people of Hammerfell seem born to battle, though their pride and fierce independence of spirit makes them more suitable as scouts or skirmishers, or as free-ranging heroes and adventurers, than as rank-and-file soldiers. In addition to their cultural affinities for many armor styles and weapons (particularly swords), Redguards are also physically blessed with hardy constitutions, resistance to poison, and quickness of foot. Unlike most other human races, they are not believed to have any connection with the ancestral Nordic homeland of Atmora.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Redguards are known for their tall, gaunt frames and finely toned physiques. They possess above average human strength and agility, and show a remarkable capacity for surviving in hot, dry climates. They generally possess dark skin, ranging from light brown in hue, to nearly black, and often with a significant red tint. They possess very curly, wiry hair, and their degree of body hair varies. Tattoos and body piercings are common.</p>\n<p>Many Redguard men show an affinity for beards. \"A man is only as great as the beard that wears him\" is an old Redguard proverb.</p>\n<h2>You Might&hellip;</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Hold your weapon in the highest regard</li>\n<li>Be a roaming mercenary</li>\n<li>Hold some disdain for the Empire</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably&hellip;</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume you have a curved sword</li>\n<li>See you as a capable warrior</li>\n<li>Question your politics</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Like all races, Redguards have been shaped by their home. Since their arrival, they have been few in number, relative to the other races of Tamriel. Their Yokudan heritage left them with advanced seafaring, agricultural, military and even astronomical knowledge that allowed them to thrive in a place where others merely hoped to survive. Redguard society is extremely martial, and nearly everyone is expected to have a grasp of basic weaponry and combat, although only the rulers are generally expected to have detailed knowledge of strategy, formations and tactics. Only the strongest, fastest and smartest Redguards are accepted into the demanding military (which consists mainly of various knightly orders; Redguards don't traditionally have a standing army), and they are expected to prove themselves worthy by facing death. Even their entertainment, like snake charming, bears some risk to it.</p>\n<p>The practice of magic has generally been frowned upon dating back to the First Era, and outsiders are not tolerated in many parts of Hammerfell. Many believe that no \"true\" Redguard would stoop to using magic, considering it a weakness. Certain schools that teach the Way of the Sword forbid students to use magic and enchanted weapons. By the Third Era, spellcasters were shunned in Hammerfell, believing them to be wicked individuals who steal souls and tamper with minds. Necromancy has always been abhorred in Redguard culture, due to their reverence of the dead. Although being suspicious of magic is regarded as a hallmark of Redguard culture, it was not always so pronounced. In ancient times, Yokudan war-wizards were part of their armies, albeit rare. Sword-singers were said to have forged swords woven with magic and indeed the Shehai itself is believed to be a form of magic.</p>\n<p>They have a great affinity for horses, and brought many with them to Hammerfell, notably the breed called the Yokudan Charger. The constellation of the Warrior and its charges seem to be of great importance in their ancient literature.</p>\n<p>Redguards have a great diversity in styles for their clothing, though it always tends to be light, long, and flowing to best tolerate the heat and hazards of the desert. They first developed this style of dress in Yokuda, which was known to have arid deserts similar to the Alik'r desert of their adopted homeland. The flowing curves of Redguard dress is mimicked in the designs of their armor and weaponry. Imperial propaganda from the late Second Era speaks of some Redguards opting to go nude in public, particularly in Rihad. Denizens of the Alik'r tend to favor lightweight leather armors to better cope with heat, and often wear face coverings to keep sand from their mouths. In their constant quest for water, they often employ johads, simple but effective water collectors made of sticks and fabric which gather the morning dew of the desert.</p>\n<p>They are a highly disciplined and enterprising people, having centuries of experience with warfare in their homeland before arriving on Tamriel's shores. Their warriors are acknowledged to be among the best in the world. The Redguards are also known for their naval prowess, and their fleets have proved a match for the Empire's best armadas, as seen during the Stros M'Kai revolt. Stros M'Kai and some parts of mainland Hammerfell hold many Dwemer ruins, and some young Redguards seeking to enter military service must brave the dangers of these ruins. Most of their holidays and traditions seem to revolve around either the celebration of natural phenomena or the commemoration of great battles and warriors.</p>\n<p>Stuffed lizards are common gifts for children. They're sometimes made to wear little tailored clothes.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>When a Redguard dies, priests typically perform a consecration ritual in the name of Tu'whacca at their funeral. Some also practice mummification of the dead. The body is laid on a table and washed in oils and leaves. Before the head and torso are carefully cut open, the body is drained of blood, and the brain, heart, and other organs are placed into ceremonial jars, followed by a week of chanting prayers, mourning, and swathing the corpse with long ceremonial bandages. The body is then interred in a painted sarcophagus within a subterranean tomb, along with the deceased's favorite weapons, servants, and pets. It's not unusual to find that their crypts and tombs can be even larger and more elaborate than their homes for the living. This is all symptomatic of a Redguard respect for departed relatives, a respect so fervent it is similar to the ancestral worship of some other cultures.</p>\n<p>Though the Redguards abhor necromancy, their religion has also led them to abhor any sort of interaction with the undead. Tradition bound them not to fight the honored dead, making them particularly vulnerable to necromancers and undead creatures. Such was the importance of this ideal, that the culture of the Alik'r evolved around it. However in later years many realized that exceptions must be made. One example is the Ash'abah, a tribe of Redguards who have made it their duty to purify mausoleums and destroy the undead wherever they may be found. As a result, they have been shunned from Redguard society, and are exiled to live as nomads in the wastes. Their existence is nevertheless tolerated due to the necessity of their role.</p>\n<p>Among their other traditions, Ash'abah tribesmen travel to Tu'whacca's Throne annually to perform the 36-hour-long Rite of Royal Rest, which is said to seal departed monarchs in their tombs and keep their spirits happy. Another form of protection against necromancy was the creation of the Ansei Wards. These ancient relics were forged as part of a covenant with Tu'whacca to ensure that the consecrated dead could not be raised by even the most powerful necromancy.</p>\n<p>Redguards have come to venerate different gods, with the Crowns sticking to the most ancient Yokudan pantheon, while Forebear beliefs have evolved to include many Imperial influences. Many of the Crowns are nomadic tribesman who mainly travel around the Alik'r, and though they adhere to traditional Yokudan beliefs, they have also developed a deep, spiritual attachment to their adopted land. They venerate deities and spirits of all kinds, from Pixies (or faeries) to Satakal the Worldskin, the god of everything (a sort of fusion of Anu and Padomay that bears similarities to the malevolent Nordic god Alduin). Occasionally, Satakal will destroy everything to begin anew, and the spirits who manage to find a way to survive are those who can move at \"strange angles\" to stride between one world and the next, and thus enter the Redguard pantheon of gods.</p>\n<p>The Crown pantheon includes Satakal and the chieftain Ruptga, or Tall Papa, the first to survive Satakal's destruction. They also venerate Zeht (Yokudan God of Farms), Tall Papa's favorite wife Morwha, Tava (considered equivalent to Kynareth), Onsi (a god of war), and Diagna. Tu'whacca was thought to be the god of \"Nobody Really Cares\" before the creation of the world, when he became a caretaker and protector of souls (similar to Arkay).</p>\n<p>The Forebear belief system includes several of the Nine Divines recognized by other cultures: Akatosh, Julianos, Dibella, and Stendarr. However, it is often unclear if they have the same understanding of these deities that others possess, as they often use a name of one of the Divines when referring to a Yokudan deity. For instance, they continue to venerate the Bird God Tava, a favorite among many Redguard sailors, but they have been known to call her Kynareth. Similarly, they may refer to Tu'whacca as Arkay, Zeht as Zenithar, and the four-armed fertility goddess Morwha as Mara.</p>\n<p>There are several other deities with significant Redguard cults among both Crowns and Forebears. Leki, the Saint of the Spirit Sword and divine daughter of Tall Papa, is credited with helping the Yokudans before their war against the Lefthanded Elves in the Mythic Era. The HoonDing, the Make Way God, is the Yokudan spirit of perseverance over infidels, and is said to materialize when the Redguard need to \"make way\" for their people. They believe this spirit appeared twice during the Ra Gada invasion.</p>\n<p>There is also the \"Horde King\" Malooc, an enemy of the Ra Gada who led goblins against them in the First Era. And finally, Sep, believed to be the Yokudan variant of Lorkhan.

In the Empire, they are often referred to as Wood Elves, but Bosmer, Boiche, or the Tree-Sap people is what they call themselves. Bosmer rejected the stiff, formal traditions of Aldmeri high culture, preferring a more romantic, simple existence in harmony with the land and its wild beauty and creatures. They are relatively nimble and quick in body compared to their more \"civilized\" Altmeri cousins (who often look down upon the Bosmer as unruly and naive). Their agility makes them well-suited as scouts and thieves. However, they are also a quick-witted folk, and many pursue successful careers in scholarly pursuits or trading.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>The best archers in all of Tamriel, the Bosmer snatch and fire arrows in one continuous motion; they are even rumored to have invented the bow. They have many natural and unique abilities; notably, they can command simple-minded creatures and have a nearly chameleon-like ability to hide in forested areas.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Mimic others' actions, attempting to conform to cultures outside of Valenwood.</li>\n<li>Conflate aspects of Bosmeri traditions with that of other races.</li>\n<li>Sharpen your teeth, or otherwise modify small aspects of your body to better suit your needs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume you are an archer or scout, and have a strong understanding of the wilderness.</li>\n<li>Focus on your cannibalistic culture, treating you with minor disgust.</li>\n<li>Feel that you're naive or aloof, and may attempt to strongarm you.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Bosmer are among the smallest ancestry across Tamriel, typically just above 5 feet tall, and usually weighing around 100 pounds. Reknown for their agility, and mastery with a bow, the Wood Elves of Valenwood are not to be taken lightly.</p>\n<p>Bosmer live two to three times as long as humans; with a 200-year-old Bosmer being old and a 300-year-old Bosmer being very, very old.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>The elves of Valenwood have always stood ready to defend themselves against aggression, and have done so on many occasions. They often rely on their forest-coupling skills to make use of guerrilla tactics. The title of their most famous poem, the Meh Ayleidion, means \"The One Thousand Benefits of Hiding\". However, the Bosmer seem to be the most pacifistic of all the modern races on Tamriel, as they have never instigated war with other nations (leading some more militant cultures to criticize them as cowards), though they have been accused of needlessly escalating some conflicts.</p>\n<p>They have never found a tried and true ally in any other Tamrielic nation. Mistrust has been engendered by the ritual cannibalism they practice, and it's often difficult for them to adjust their lifestyles to the expectations of other races and cultures. Nevertheless, the Bosmer are heavily dependent on good relations and trade with other races, as the Green Pact forces them to import the timber needed to make their homes, arrows, and other wooden instruments.</p>\n<p>They have attempted to accommodate other races in Valenwood throughout history, though many remained wary of outlander encroachments into their home. To this day, they have little more than foot paths connecting their tiny settlements in Valenwood's sparsely populated forests. Some primitive Bosmer practice cannibalism upon their enemies. Some Bosmer have been known to file their teeth to sharp points. It is also common among the Bosmer to wear decorative antlers on their foreheads, although rarely, individuals with real, magically-grown antlers can also be encountered.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>The Bosmer venerate many deities. In fact, few Bosmer outside the Empire accept the limitation of Divines to a mere eight or nine. Most Bosmer claim direct descent from Auri-El, though Y'ffre the Storyteller is their most important deity. While the Time Dragon is the king of the gods, they venerate Y'ffre as the spirit of \"the now\". Like the Argonians, the Bosmer seem to prefer to live in the present, or the \"Aurbic Now\", and show relatively little regard for the ways of the past (besides when it comes to telling old tales or following the Green Pact, that is).</p>\n<p>The Bosmer also venerate Arkay, Xarxes, Mara (who they consider to be the wife of Auri-El), and Stendarr. The God of Toil, Z'en, is the Bosmeri god of payment in kind. His origins are mysterious, as is his place in the cosmic order. The Bosmer are one of the few who worship the trickster Baan Dar, the trickster spirit of thieves and beggars they apparently borrowed from the Khajiit.</p>\n<p>There are many other deities with significant Bosmer cults, such as Hircine. They also worship the moon gods Jone and Jode. Ancient stories of the supernatural, enigmatic Wilderking abound in Greenshade.Like the Nords, the trickster spirit Herma-Mora appears in their legends (and they insist he is not to be confused with the Daedra Hermaeus Mora). And, of course, in a culture replete with trickster spirits, they do not forget the greatest trickster of all: Lorkhan.</p>\n<h2>The Green Pact</h2>\n<p>The Green Pact, also known as the Treaty of Frond and Leaf, is a strict code upheld by many of the Bosmer of Valenwood. It is said to have guided their existence since the beginning of the \"great story\". Its rules are clear:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not harm the forests of Valenwood.</li>\n<li>Do not eat anything made from plant life.</li>\n<li>Eat only meat.</li>\n<li>When enemies are conquered, their meat must be eaten, not left to rot.</li>\n<li>Do not kill wastefully.</li>\n<li>Do not take on the shape of beasts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Though many Bosmer still try to respect the Green Pact, the practice of eating dead enemies diminished by the Second Era, and is typically only practiced in the most remote villages. The Green Pact Bosmer are known as fierce warriors, but are also known for the hospitality they exhibit to outsiders who respect their ways.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They are religiously carnivorous and cannibalistic, and do not harm the vegetation of Valenwood, though they are not averse to using wooden or plant-derived products created by others. Their stories speak of the Ooze, a purgatorial state reserved for Bosmer who violate the Pact (who are called Apostates), as well as the harsh punishments the Green unleashes on those who would harm it.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>The Wood Elves of Valenwood often depart their homeland in hopes of growing beyond the traditional customs, though some end up turning to a life of crime in this pursuit. Many Bosmer grow to be excellent rangers, but they are also terrifyingly skilled rogues and thieves.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["hb_bosmer","humanoid"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.8,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-11-18T12:04:54.573-08:00","version":{"schema":0.796,"foundry":"10.290","system":"4.4.0"}}},"hp":8,"size":"med","reach":5,"speed":30,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["dex"]},"1":{"value":["cha","con","dex","int","str","wis"]},"2":{"value":[]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":[]}},"languages":{"value":["bosmeris","common"],"custom":""},"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"value":[],"custom":""},"items":{},"vision":"normal","voluntaryBoosts":{},"voluntaryFlaws":{},"rarity":{"value":"common"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.4.0","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":1668802238348,"modifiedTime":1668802238348,"lastModifiedBy":"vVBkRn7sTCpUhdHE"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"vVBkRn7sTCpUhdHE":3}}

They are also known as High Elves by the denizens of Tamriel. In the Empire, \"High\" is often understood to mean proud or snobbish, and as the Altmer generally personify these characteristics, the \"lesser races\" generally resent them. Altmer live two to three times as long as humans; with a 200-year-old Altmer being old and a 300-year-old Altmer being very, very old. Altmer consider themselves to be the most civilized culture of Tamriel; the common tongue of the continent is based on Altmer speech and writing, and most of the Empire's arts, crafts, laws, and sciences are derived from Altmer traditions.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>The Altmer are the most strongly gifted in the arcane arts of all the races, and they are very resistant to diseases. However, they are also somewhat vulnerable to magicka, fire, frost, and shock, which makes them very weak against their strongest point - magic. They are among the longest living and most intelligent races of Tamriel, and they often become powerful magic users due to both their magical affinity and the many years they may devote to their studies.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Look down on other non-mer races, see yourself as above strangers and common folk, and/or find the worship of some gods repulsive or heretical.</li>\n<li>Talk over others, assume your opinion to be fact or of the most important, and/or lecture others on obscure topics you devoted time to.</li>\n<li>Have prominent facial features, such as: high cheekbones, strong jawline, etc. This could also include minor things such as tilting your head back to show your superiority.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Seek your approval, hoping to gain some knowledge about the Summerset Isles or of your upbringing and personal intellect.</li>\n<li>Assume you are well-learned in a school of magicka, come from some minor noble family, or have a background in wealth.</li>\n<li>Dislike your haughty attitude, sometimes treating you with disdain or avoiding you completely.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Typically taller than other mer, usually above 6 feet, Altmer are commonly lean, not weighing much more than 140 pounds. Sneering down at most other races, outside of themselves, but targeted mostly at man folk, they carry themselves with a weight of significance. Their skin palette focuses on light yellows, giving them the &lsquo;gold skin&rsquo; moniker. However, some vary closer to an orange and even yellow-green. Their eye color usually mimics their skin, giving them an aura of symmetry and elegance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Altmer reach physical adulthood around the age of 30, though are considered immature and young in comparison to their elders. Maturity is typically reached around 80 years old, but some may have harsher or lighter upbringings.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>The Altmer of Summerset had a relatively egalitarian society, though social stratification slowly developed into a rigid hierarchy of classes over the millennia. The Wise (teachers and priests) became the highest echelon, followed by Artists, Princes, Warriors, Landowners, Merchants, Workers, and enslaved beasts such as Goblins.</p>\n<p>Early literature by man painted the High Elves in poor light, though the impartiality of these accounts is questionable. It was suggested that the Altmer practiced eugenic infanticide, putting to death nine in ten of their newborns due to impurities, that Altmeri names are simply combinations of numbers in their own language, and that Altmer culture revolves around displaying social status.</p>\n<p>Some time in the Merethic Era, one early group of dissidents who opposed the evolution to the traditional Altmer pantheon left the mainland of Summerset but remained quintessentially Altmer. The Psijics decided to follow the mystical Old Ways of Aldmeris and broke away to settle Artaeum, the third largest island of the Isle, though they apparently managed to stay friendly with their snubbed mainland brethren and it's assumed they use their advanced magic to help protect the Altmer in times of strife.</p>\n<p>In recent times (for an Altmer, the last several hundred years), the younger Altmer have been pushing for social reform, an unusual phenomenon for a people who are used to dissidents simply leaving. Many young rebellious Altmer have turned to the Psijics for guidance (somewhat ironically consulting their distant past for a path to their future), while some militant radicals have turned to terrorism.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Altmer are often logical and cold, harboring little emotional care for anything outside of their focus. Many are lawful neutral, typically staying close to their studies or advancement, but rarely seek to help or put down those around them, save in grave or extreme circumstances. Most follow Auri-el, the chief elven deity, as well as other minor gods in the elven domain, typically associated with their place in life.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>As high elves grow, they are likely to devise ways to gain an edge on their peers, typically venturing into mainland Tamriel. Usual backgrounds for an Altmer include artist, merchant, noble, and scholar. They often become excellent mages, but have been found to be shrewd tacticians, proving their ability as warriors, spellswords, and even crusaders at times.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["humanoid"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.8,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-11-18T12:04:54.999-08:00","version":{"schema":0.796,"foundry":"10.290","system":"4.4.0"}}},"hp":6,"size":"med","reach":5,"speed":25,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["int"]},"1":{"value":[]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":[]}},"languages":{"value":["common","high elvish"],"custom":""},"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"value":[],"custom":""},"items":{},"vision":"normal","voluntaryBoosts":{},"voluntaryFlaws":{},"rarity":{"value":"common"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.4.2","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1668802238347,"modifiedTime":1670545359931,"lastModifiedBy":"rbAxRrlSdHM65IFE"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"vVBkRn7sTCpUhdHE":3}}

They are usually slight of build and not as muscular as Nords or Redguards. The great diversity in their appearance is to be expected from their politically fractured society, though their clothes, accents, customs and names are fairly uniform.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>The Bretons' largely agrarian and hierarchical society is feudal in nature. Most Breton cities are sprawling trade hubs, with Breton society consisting of the peasantry, the middle class, the magical elite, and the nobility. The jockeying for power among the various monarchs and powers of the Iliac Bay region is a deeply ingrained, even cherished, part of Breton culture. Though they have several paths to prosperity, becoming a nobleman by performing quests and services to curry favor with various rulers is considered the best way, which has created a cultural \"quest obsession\" among young Bretons. The desire to find some great opportunity for fortune and glory has made Bretons venture all over Tamriel, even to such remote locations as Thirsk on the island of Solstheim, where one adventurous Breton once earned the position of chieftain. Many use their magical talents to earn success. They're often considered a friendly and humorous people, though there is little love lost between many Bretons and Redguards following the vicious War of Betony.</p>\n<p>Bretons are said to enjoy intellectual pursuits; they often have an affinity for anything related to logic and ordered complexity. Their love of knowledge and affinity for commerce drives them into a host of careers, including trading, the military, sailing, medicine, textiles, manufacturing, writing, theology, philosophy, banking, all kinds of artistry, and other scholarly pursuits. Espionage has also proven to be one of their strong suits; Breton double agents, assassins, and spies have turned the tide of wars throughout recorded history.</p>\n<p>Breton society is famous for its knightly orders, with notable examples including the Knights of the Dragon of Daggerfall, the Knights of the Rose of Wayrest, the Knights of the Flame of Anticlere, and the Order of the Raven of Dwynnen. Breton knights espouse the traditional chivalric principles of Breton society and are among the most prominent practitioners of High Rock's culture of questing. One of the most legendary heroes of High Rock was the Breton knight Eleidon in the First Era, owner of the eponymous Eleidon's Ward.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Bretons are not disposed to \"excessive religion\", but most accepted the Aldmeri pantheon of gods while under elven rule, then made the transition to the Divines. The most notable spirits traditionally worshipped by Bretons are Akatosh, Magnus, Jephre, Dibella, Arkay, Zenithar, Mara, Stendarr, Kynareth, Julianos, and Phynaster. They also recognize Sheor, the Bad Man, believed to have been introduced by the elves during their conflicts with the Nords as a demonized version of Shor.</p>\n<p>People of the northern regions of High Rock cremate their dead, while burial remains common in the south.</p>\n<p>The Reachmen of eastern High Rock and western Skyrim are thought to be partially descended from the Bretons, but diverge severely in their culture and traditions.

Some Reachmen have settled in towns such as Markarth and integrated into modern society, but many still violently resist any outside occupiers of their tribal lands, calling themselves the Forsworn.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Bretons often leave home in search of new sights, new things to learn, as such, becoming a master duelist, wise tactician, or a charming swindler are typical fates.

They are known as the foremost experts in guerrilla warfare throughout Tamriel, a reputation brought upon them by defending their borders from enemies for countless centuries.

Thanks to this, they can be found wandering the cold environments of Solstheim and Skyrim without any negative repercussions.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Most, if not all Argonian tribes revere and build their lives around a Hist tree. They ingest its sap during rituals, lay their eggs among its roots, and often live according to the Hist's will. Tribes that build their lives around a Hist often do so literally, as they construct their settlements around the Hist.</p>\n<p>Argonian leaders known as tree-minders tend to the tribe's Hist and seek its wisdom through communication with the tree. On rare occasions, the Hist may speak directly with an individual, though most tree-minders can interpret signs sent by the Hist.</p>\n<p>Some tribes possess a sap-speaker, who is a direct intermediary with the Hist. The sap-speaker will spend days or weeks at a time among the roots and canopy of the Hist; ingesting sap, eating the otherwise forbidden fruit of the tree, and using many hours of the day to indulge in solitary contemplation. The sap-speaker emerges from their solitude with the knowledge they've acquired from the Hist during their long bouts of study.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Except for the more deeply assimilated, the Argonians do not formally recognize or worship any type of Tamrielic deity.

Their hegemony has waxed and waned throughout the eras, and most historians refer to three distinct Empires, the ends of which each mark a new epoch in Tamrielic history.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Imperials most closely resemble the original Nedic men of Nirn. Female imperials average around 5'6\" and 110 pounds, while males average around 5'10\" and 150 pounds. Their hair varies, ranging across darks to blonde, and curly to straight. This similar range applies to their eye color as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Like other races of man, imperials live around 80 years, however there have been imperials in history that have exceeded this average by 30 or more years (likely attributed to magical means). Imperials typically mature around 18 years of age.</p>\n<h2>You Might&hellip;</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Engage in bureaucracy, or other forms of political action</li>\n<li>Travel across Tamriel, looking for new pathways in life</li>\n<li>Pursue a merchant career, or another business venture</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably&hellip;</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>See you as open to diplomatic converstions</li>\n<li>Assume you are well learned</li>\n<li>Believe you have some connection to the Empire</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>The defining feature of Imperial culture is its cosmopolitanism. Although some individuals may be the most arrogant bigots in Tamriel, culturally the Imperials are very conciliatory and congenial, making them skilled diplomats and traders.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Even Imperial Vampires claim some semblance of civility. It's easy to understand given their geography and cultural schisms: Cyrodiil borders almost every other province, and the historical separation yet underlying unity and interaction of the Cyrodilic regions made the Imperials well practiced at building bridges and maintaining order. Though there are many regions, the two most powerful effectively controlled all regions close to them: the western Colovian Estates and the eastern Nibenay Valley.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Early Imperials in eastern Cyrodiil strongly believed in the Alessian Doctrines, even after the Empire's fall, which made them disfavor many practices, notably farming. They defaulted to mercantilism, and became a wealthy merchant power with a vibrant society that made colorful clothing, conducted elaborate ceremonies, and loved tattoos and philosophy. Through their river network, they were able to export many goods, including textiles, fabrics, moon sugar, rice and armor. Though their beliefs were monotheistic, they often focused on the numinous nature of some facet of society, and many diverse cults operated openly over the years, dedicated to many animal spirits and hero-gods, as well as ancestor worship. The Colovians, in contrast, took on a more austere but adventuresome lifestyle, in keeping with their Nordic ancestry, and often became mercenaries and pirates. The unification under Reman I didn't eradicate these differences, although, of course, the Eight Divines was predominant all over the province by the end of the First Era.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The respect and admiration Imperials had for Tiber Septim is nothing compared to the veneration they have for him as a god of the Nine Divines, regardless of the heresies often espoused about him.</p>\n<p>His accomplishments inspired them to believe they could do anything they set their mind to. The end of his dynasty was greeted with great mourning, although also with great pride, as his last known descendant, Martin Septim, sacrificed himself to save all of Tamriel. Imperials know all too well that dynasties are destined to rise and fall; all it will take is time before the Glorious Empire once again reigns over Tamriel.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Imperial Religion primary focuses on the Eight Divines, or the Eight and One which includes the ascended Talos. The Imperials have a lot of cults dedicated to various religions with the Imperial City. Despite this, the Imperials have a history of restricting and banning the worship of deities that are not of the traditional Eight Divines. The study of these other gods was encouraged though. During the First Empire, the Imperials were strictly forbidden from worshiping or idolizing the deities Magnus, Y'ffre, Sheor, and Phynaster and worship of these deities was considered heresy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The Imperials generally have a negative view of Daedra, with notable differences between the behavior of Colovians and the Nibenesse during the Interregnum. As Colovians are especially religious, they will typically refuse to associate themselves with Daedra. During this period, however, the Nibenese were more inclined to turn to Daedra worship. In Tiber Septim's empire, the Daedric Princes were invoked as the 16 Acceptable Blasphemies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The Imperial's distaste for Daedra was readily apparent during the reign of the Longhouse Emperors, a short-lived Reachfolk Dynasty that was brought to an end after Emperor Leovic legalized Daedra worship (allegedly at the behest of corrupt advisors). Leovic consequently drew the ire of many nobles who had once been counted among his supporters. One of these erstwhile supporters, Duke Varen Aquilarios of Chorrol, marshaled the armies of the Colovian Estates and led them against Leovic in open rebellion from 2E 576 to 2E 577. In the end, Varen killed Leovic in the Imperial Throne Room, and the reign of the Longhouse Emperors came to a close.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; House Tharn of Nibenay has always kept ties with the forces of Oblivion. During Emperor Varen's reign, Abnur Tharn unwittingly helped Mannimarco cause the Soulburst, and subsequently pledged his loyalty to the necromancer (and by extension, Molag Bal) in the interest of preserving the Empire. Unlike Abnur Tharn, several other members of the family had aligned themselves with Molag Bal wholesale: Abnur's nephew Javad was a prominent figure in the Stonefire Cult (an offshoot of Mannimarco's Worm Cult), and Septima Tharn led the Seventh Legion in the Daedric Prince's name.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The Tharn family's dealings with Molag Bal was the primary motivator for the Daggerfall Convenant, Aldmeri Dominion and Ebonheart Pact's invasion of Cyrodiil. At first, their goal was to depose the Tharn family, but the conflict devolved into the Alliance War. To his credit, Abnur Tharn joined the Five Companions in their quest to end the Planemeld.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Despite the Imperial distaste for Daedra worship, it is not banned in Cyrodiil, due in part to the Imperial Charter that permits the Mages Guild to summon Daedra. However, the opinion of religious institutions and the general public is hostile, a fact that encourages Daedra worshippers to practice in secret. Some even build their shrines out in the wilderness, where they may be attended by a community of faithful in peace.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Sanguine has been a favorite for several Emperors since the foundation of the first Empire. During the reign of Reman Cyrodiil records indicate Sanguine resided in White-Gold Tower where he is said to have helped Reman with the dubious draftsmanship of the Crendali Festivals. The vulgarities found within these festivals did nothing but hinder Imperial expansion efforts within the Summerset Isles during Reman Cyrodiil's tenure.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Imperials find themselves in every part of society, and have the natural adaptability to fill any role. Many have risen to become powerful mages, while others cement themselves in history as legendary warriors.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["humanoid"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.8,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-11-18T12:04:53.239-08:00","version":{"schema":0.796,"foundry":"10.290","system":"4.4.0"}}},"hp":8,"size":"med","reach":5,"speed":25,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["cha","con","dex","int","str","wis"]},"1":{"value":["cha","con","dex","int","str","wis"]},"2":{"value":[]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":[]}},"languages":{"value":["common"],"custom":""},"additionalLanguages":{"count":2,"value":[],"custom":""},"items":{},"vision":"normal","voluntaryBoosts":{},"voluntaryFlaws":{},"rarity":{"value":"common"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.4.2","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1668802238349,"modifiedTime":1670546171179,"lastModifiedBy":"rbAxRrlSdHM65IFE"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"vVBkRn7sTCpUhdHE":3}}

They are fierce, strong and enthusiastic warriors, and many become renowned warriors, soldiers and mercenaries all over Tamriel. Eager to augment their martial skills beyond the traditional methods of Skyrim, they excel in all manner of warfare, and are known as a militant people by their neighbors. Nords were known for a time for their nautical prowess when they migrated from Atmora.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Nords are typically fair skinned and of large builds, with hair color ranging in blondes and brunettes. Most average around 6-feet tall, and weigh between 140 to 200 pounds. Eyes of the nords are usually blue or brown, though this may not always be the case.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Nord life spans average around 80 years, but some have been reported to live slightly longer lives. They reach physical maturity around 16 years of age, though their mentality can take up to an additional decade to fully mature.</p>\n<h2>You Might&hellip;</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Hold your family in the highest esteem</li>\n<li>Seek to protect those closest to you</li>\n<li>Harbor resentment toward the elven races</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably&hellip;</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>See you as hardy and strong</li>\n<li>Think you prefer the colder climates</li>\n<li>Assume you are stubborn</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>There are two things most Nords love: music and mead. Most Nords wear animal skins or cotton clothing. They are generally tolerant of outsiders to Skyrim, though often do not make them feel welcome. In particular, Nords often still hold a bitter resentment towards elves. The Reach, one of the nine Holds of Skyrim, has only a slight Nord majority, and cities in the east have become heavily influenced by the Dunmer. The northern and eastern holds - Winterhold, Eastmarch, The Rift, and The Pale&mdash;are known collectively as the Old Holds, where the influence of old Nordic traditions is still relatively strong and outsiders are rare. The young men there go out for weeks into the high peaks in the dead of winter, hunting the ice wraiths that give them claim to full status as citizens. The Reach and the Rift both have long histories of lawlessness, and are generally associated with criminal activity.</p>\n<p>Nords tend to be superstitious, and their folklore reflects this. Nordic names, often chosen based on omens, are given in a special ceremony when the child is young. Any unexplained misfortune is often blamed on the Falmer, or Snow Elves. The Falmer, long believed to be extinct after the vengeful Nordic invasion into their lands, caused by the aggressive Falmer response to the new Atmoran inhabitants, were actually driven deep underground, where they became feral and purportedly seek to kill all those who dwell above them, so it's possible there's truth in some of these claims.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>The Nords are considered to be a devout people with grim religious beliefs. Among other things, they have long believed that Alduin, the World-Eater, would eventually return and bring about the end of the world. As dark as their belief systems are viewed to be, all Nordic traditions extend one bright, shining hope for Nords: Sovngarde, the Hall of Valor, where Nords who have proven their mettle in battle or died valiantly are welcome to experience euphoric bliss and camaraderie, free from time and boredom. Some stories claim the place was built by, and still inhabited by, the elusive Shor. It is little surprise that cowardice is the worst trait a Nord can exhibit, for \"a Nord is judged not by the manner in which he lived, but the manner in which he died\". Nords cross the whalebone bridge to reach Sovngarde, and flying whales are a cultural metaphor for the transition from Nirn to Aetherius.</p>\n<p>Ysgramor and the Atmorans brought with them the worship of animal gods: the hawk, wolf, snake, moth, owl, whale, bear, fox, and most importantly the dragon. Over time, as Nord beliefs evolved, the traditional Nordic Pantheon of Divines emerged as personifications of natural forces and ideas. Many scholars believe that the Nordic Pantheon is the same as the orthodox pantheon, merely with different names (there are certainly many parallels), and many Nords who have adopted the Divines evidently have this understanding.</p>\n<p>The isolated Nordic tribe in Solstheim, the Skaal, carry on a tradition very similar to the old tradition of animal worship. The Skaal venerate all of nature, believing that certain parts of their environment, such as the winds, the trees and the sun, were given to them by the All-Maker, a benevolent, unknowable creator deity. Wolves and bears are especially sacred to the small tribe. All aspects of nature must constantly be in harmony, for this is what gives the Skaal their shamanic powers. The Skaal also tell tales of the Adversary, the enemy of mankind, and his lieutenant, the Greedy Man. In this regard, the faith of the Skaal is nearly the opposite of the pantheon of their kin in Skyrim. Although the Skaal do not worship them, they also acknowledge the existence of the Daedric Princes.</p>\n<p>Nords typically follow a neutral alignment, their disposition is reflected most often on their clan, leaving them as a very open ended race, full of potential and strength.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Average nords find inner calling in the ways of the barbarian, bard, druid, fighter, and monk. However there have been exceptional nord wizards across history, should one find interest in the matter. These paths lead nords to be natural leaders on the battlefield, and exceptional friends off it.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["hb_nord","humanoid"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.8,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-11-18T12:04:52.348-08:00","version":{"schema":0.796,"foundry":"10.290","system":"4.4.0"}}},"hp":10,"size":"med","reach":5,"speed":25,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["str"]},"1":{"value":["cha"]},"2":{"value":["cha","con","dex","int","str","wis"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":["int"]}},"languages":{"value":["common","nordic"],"custom":""},"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"value":[],"custom":""},"items":{"1rw4y":{"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Child of the Sky","level":0,"uuid":"Item.wIrycUURTb2UHg5D"}},"vision":"normal","voluntaryBoosts":{},"voluntaryFlaws":{},"rarity":{"value":"common"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.4.0","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":1668802238350,"modifiedTime":1668802238350,"lastModifiedBy":"vVBkRn7sTCpUhdHE"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"vVBkRn7sTCpUhdHE":3}}

In the Empire, \"Dark Elf\" is the common usage, but among their Aldmeri brethren they are called \"Dunmer\". \"Dark\" is variously interpreted as meaning \"dark-skinned\", \"gloomy\", and \"ill-favored by fate\", with the Dunmer and their national identity embracing these various connotations with enthusiasm. Their combination of powerful intellects with agile physiques produce superior warriors and sorcerers. On the battlefield, Dunmer are noted for their skill with a balanced integration of the sword, the bow and destruction magic. Dunmer live two to three times as long as humans; with a 200-year-old Dunmer being old and a 300-year-old Dunmer being very, very old. In character, they are grim, aloof, and reserved, as well as distrusting and disdainful of other races.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Dunmer distrust and are treated distrustfully by other races. They are often called proud, clannish, ruthless, and cruel, from an outsider's point of view, but greatly value loyalty and family. Young female Dunmer have a reputation for promiscuity according to at least one account, although Dunmer culture itself makes no reference to this. Despite their powerful skills and strengths, the Dunmer's vengeful nature, age-old conflicts, betrayals, and ill-reputation prevent them from gaining more influence. Those born in their homeland of Morrowind before its devastation were known to be considerably less friendly than those who grew up in the Imperial tradition.</p>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Dunmer often measure just under 6 feet tall, usually on par with average members of the races of man. Typically, dunmer have ash gray skin, though some have shades of blue, with deep red eyes. Physical maturity for dunmer is achieved relatively early in comparison to their longevity (usually late teens), while mental maturity is more dependent on personal upbringing.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Look down on other races, especially beastfolk and manfolk.</li>\n<li>Distrust those you are unfamiliar with or have not engaged with philosophically.</li>\n<li>Take extreme pride in your work, often working alone for days at a time.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n<li>View you as self-serving and cold, often distrusting of your true motives.</li>\n<li>Watch what they say around you, worried you may use it against them.</li>\n<li>Find you arrogant or otherwise full of yourself.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>The Dunmer have been defined by their environment. Red Mountain looms as large in their collective thought as it does on the horizon. Its ash and lava sculpted the attitudes of Vvardenfell residents. One does not have to travel far outside of many cities to find a giant Foyada cutting through the land like a scar. Native-born Dunmer tended to look down on \"outlanders\", which include both other races and Dunmer born outside of Morrowind, though the intensity of this ethnocentrism varies. For thousands of years under the Tribunal, Dunmer society was structured much like the Chimer society had been: domestic Great Houses governed by Ruling Councils competed against each other for power and territory, while nomadic groups eschewed relative modernity for ancient tribal practices.</p>\n<p>Houses tend to rise and fall; many have faded to extinction over the years or sprouted up to challenge others. At the close of the Third Era, the five most important houses were Hlaalu, Redoran, Telvanni, Dres and Indoril, each which had existed for thousands of years, since at least the War of the First Council. While the details are limited, it is known that each of the Houses survived the cataclysms following the fall of the Tribunal Temple - with the exception of House Hlaalu, which lost its position to the previously-unknown House Sadras. In the most recent two centuries, House Redoran has become the most powerful of the Great Houses, taking the mantle the Hlaalu had held prior, and the Indoril before them. Historically, Indoril has been so heavily involved with the Temple itself that it is hard to distinguish the two. Following the collapse of the Tribunal Temple, House Indoril and the New Temple became regarded as one in the same. In the Ashlands, native tribes ruled without laws or government and lived strictly by codes, rituals, and ancient traditions usually dictated by a wise woman or seer and implemented by a clan leader. They lived in the deserts and plains of the Ashlands and Grazelands.</p>\n<p>The \"peaceful\" status quo for Dunmer was considered quite 'savage' by westerners, even when led by living gods. Political machinations are constant. Assassinations are common; with the legally established Morag Tong providing services. A huge amount of black market activity thrives along Morrowind's extensive coastlines. Dissidents to the Temple and other subversives over the years have been hunted and persecuted. Slavery used to be commonplace. Mostly Khajiit or Argonian slaves were trafficked, although many men and mer were also enslaved. Goblins were also seen as a significant slave \"resource\". The Third Empire of Tiber Septim had banned slavery, but Dunmer were allowed to keep their own sacred and traditional laws in their entrance to the Empire. Despite these claims that owning slaves is their right, many Dunmer still found the practice abhorrent and immoral, and abolitionist groups continued to crop up within Dunmeri society. By the end of the Third Era, the abolitionists had won, and King Helseth officially abolished slavery. Necromancy is also practiced openly by some Dunmer, though never with Dunmer corpses.</p>\n<p>The Great Houses generally followed the established Tribunal Temple, which preached faith for the Tribunal, respect for the \"Good Daedra\" who recognized the Tribunal, and veneration of ancestors. There was some practicality to this: ancestral remains are used to power ghost fences to ward off spirits, notably the one created by the Tribunal at the closing of the Second Era that surrounded Red Mountain for hundreds of years to keep Dagoth Ur and his minions at bay. Historically, the Dunmer have resisted worshipping the Aedra of the Nine Divines, whom they viewed as heretical apostasies whose worshippers were on occasion punished severely. The Dunmer were swift in re-establishing the traditions of ancestor and Daedra worship that Ashlanders had kept alive as the New Temple.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Dunmer are methodical and efficient, preferring to act within a rigid structure of their own ideology. Most are lawful, though given the stakes of the constantly shifting political games of Morrowind, they are willing to commit murder and poison those they deem as threats.</p>\n<p>Since the reintegration of the \"Good Daedra\" and the phasing out of House Hlaalu's prominence, the dunmer have grown more united as a people, looking to work together towards a common goal in part due to the events of the Red Year and the following argonian invasion. Currently, dunmer religion focuses on the teachings of Azura, Boethia, and Mephala, as well as the prophet Veloth, and the tribune saints: Almalexia, Sotha Sil, and Vivec.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>As the militant House Redoran has been leading the dunmer people for the past century, most dunmer have found work as adept spellswords and mercenaries. The Morag Tong offers rogues a chance to test their mettle in the assassination business, while House Telvanni produces some of the finest mages on Tamriel.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["hb_dunmer","humanoid"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.8,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-11-18T12:04:54.140-08:00","version":{"schema":0.796,"foundry":"10.290","system":"4.4.0"}}},"hp":8,"size":"med","reach":5,"speed":25,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["con"]},"1":{"value":["int"]},"2":{"value":["cha","con","dex","int","str","wis"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":["str"]}},"languages":{"value":["common","dunmeris"],"custom":""},"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"value":[],"custom":""},"items":{"3A1wQ":{"uuid":"Item.54RP7kOfDDnJ9YGt","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Fire Resistance","level":0}},"vision":"normal","voluntaryBoosts":{},"voluntaryFlaws":{},"rarity":{"value":"common"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.4.0","coreVersion":"10.290","createdTime":1668802238348,"modifiedTime":1668802238348,"lastModifiedBy":"vVBkRn7sTCpUhdHE"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"vVBkRn7sTCpUhdHE":3}}

However, they are also somewhat vulnerable to magicka, fire, frost, and shock, which makes them very weak against their strongest point - magic.

Their eye color usually mimics their skin, giving them an aura of symmetry and elegance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Altmer reach physical adulthood around the age of 30, though are considered immature and young in comparison to their elders. Maturity is typically reached around 80 years old, but some may have harsher or lighter upbringings.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>The Altmer of Summerset had a relatively egalitarian society, though social stratification slowly developed into a rigid hierarchy of classes over the millennia. The Wise (teachers and priests) became the highest echelon, followed by Artists, Princes, Warriors, Landowners, Merchants, Workers, and enslaved beasts such as Goblins.</p>\n<p>Early literature by man painted the High Elves in poor light, though the impartiality of these accounts is questionable. It was suggested that the Altmer practiced eugenic infanticide, putting to death nine in ten of their newborns due to impurities, that Altmeri names are simply combinations of numbers in their own language, and that Altmer culture revolves around displaying social status.</p>\n<p>Some time in the Merethic Era, one early group of dissidents who opposed the evolution to the traditional Altmer pantheon left the mainland of Summerset but remained quintessentially Altmer. The Psijics decided to follow the mystical Old Ways of Aldmeris and broke away to settle Artaeum, the third largest island of the Isle, though they apparently managed to stay friendly with their snubbed mainland brethren and it's assumed they use their advanced magic to help protect the Altmer in times of strife.</p>\n<p>In recent times (for an Altmer, the last several hundred years), the younger Altmer have been pushing for social reform, an unusual phenomenon for a people who are used to dissidents simply leaving. Many young rebellious Altmer have turned to the Psijics for guidance (somewhat ironically consulting their distant past for a path to their future), while some militant radicals have turned to terrorism.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Altmer are often logical and cold, harboring little emotional care for anything outside of their focus. Many are lawful neutral, typically staying close to their studies or advancement, but rarely seek to help or put down those around them, save in grave or extreme circumstances. Most follow Auri-el, the chief elven deity, as well as other minor gods in the elven domain, typically associated with their place in life.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>As high elves grow, they are likely to devise ways to gain an edge on their peers, typically venturing into mainland Tamriel.

The other races often refer to them as \"lizards\" or the \"Lizard Folk\" instead, especially when meaning to be derogatory. They are known as the foremost experts in guerrilla warfare throughout Tamriel, a reputation brought upon them by defending their borders from enemies for countless centuries. Argonians have a lifespan similar to that of humans.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>According to the First Era Scholar Brendan the Persistent, \"the Argonian people have, throughout Tamrielic history, been perhaps the most misunderstood, vilified, and reviled of all the sentient races. Yet, those who have taken the time to experience Argonian culture have gained a greater appreciation for this noble and beautiful people.\" However, it should be noted that he himself went missing in his final expedition into the deeper swamps of their homeland.</p>\n<h2>You Might...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Demonstrate extreme patience, even when pressured to act.</li>\n<li>Hold your people&rsquo;s history in high regard and look to the past for solutions to present problems.</li>\n<li>Strive to adapt perfectly to your environment while also keeping your culture and traditions intact.<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Others Probably...</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Assume you are beholden to tradition and have ancient knowledge.</li>\n<li>See you as cold-blooded and callous due to your subdued physical reactions.</li>\n<li>Respect your impressive strength and your knowledge of natural areas.<span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Physical Description</h2>\n<p>Although Argonians appear reptilian in nature at first glance, they also exhibit qualities of fish, amphibians, and even birds: they are able to breathe underwater through small gills behind their ears, swim using the same method as that of a tadpole or eel by moving their tail side-to-side to propel through the water, and are capable of growing feathers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Argonian appearances range from reptilian to almost human; this is caused by the Hist sap they ingest as hatchlings. Strange and reclusive Argonians that live in places away from sunlight, such as subterranean caverns, will lose the color of their scales and become pale.</p>\n<p>Though the Saxhleel seem to generally be cold-blooded, they can apparently regulate their body temperatures just as effectively as their mammalian counterparts. Thanks to this, they can be found wandering the cold environments of Solstheim and Skyrim without any negative repercussions.</p>\n<h2>Society</h2>\n<p>Most, if not all Argonian tribes revere and build their lives around a Hist tree. They ingest its sap during rituals, lay their eggs among its roots, and often live according to the Hist's will. Tribes that build their lives around a Hist often do so literally, as they construct their settlements around the Hist.</p>\n<p>Argonian leaders known as tree-minders tend to the tribe's Hist and seek its wisdom through communication with the tree. On rare occasions, the Hist may speak directly with an individual, though most tree-minders can interpret signs sent by the Hist.</p>\n<p>Some tribes possess a sap-speaker, who is a direct intermediary with the Hist. The sap-speaker will spend days or weeks at a time among the roots and canopy of the Hist; ingesting sap, eating the otherwise forbidden fruit of the tree, and using many hours of the day to indulge in solitary contemplation. The sap-speaker emerges from their solitude with the knowledge they've acquired from the Hist during their long bouts of study.</p>\n<h2>Alignment and Religion</h2>\n<p>Except for the more deeply assimilated, the Argonians do not formally recognize or worship any type of Tamrielic deity. Some believe that they worship their creators, the Hist, although Argonians themselves state that they only perform rituals in their honor instead of fully worshipping them. The Argonians also revere Sithis, a being that even the Hist acknowledges.</p>\n<p>The Clutch of Nisswo is a group of priests dedicated to Sithis who wander across Murkmire to collect the 'many truths' of each tribe and share each tribes beliefs with other tribes. Z'en, the Bosmeri God of Toil, is thought to have originated in Argonian and Akaviri mythologies before being introduced to Valenwood by Kothringi sailors.</p>\n<h2>Adventurers</h2>\n<p>Typical argonians are inclined to stay within the bounds of Black Marsh, but those that leave their home behind go on to become marvelous fighters, excellent druids, and cunning rogues. Their natural abilities allow them to exceed in most aspects of life across Tamriel.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":["hb_argonian","humanoid"],"rarity":"common","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.8,"lastMigration":{"datetime":"2022-11-18T12:04:54.998-08:00","version":{"schema":0.796,"foundry":"10.290","system":"4.4.0"}}},"hp":10,"size":"med","reach":5,"speed":20,"boosts":{"0":{"value":["con"]},"1":{"value":["wis"]},"2":{"value":["str","dex","con","int","wis","cha"]}},"flaws":{"0":{"value":["cha"]}},"languages":{"value":["common","hb_jel"],"custom":""},"additionalLanguages":{"count":0,"value":[],"custom":""},"items":{"dMhWU":{"uuid":"Item.TGT3tqDbCPm0GxjH","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Disease Resistant","level":0},"5ZhvS":{"uuid":"Item.pnJXDF4Qg5vld8Ny","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/feat.svg","name":"Water Breathing","level":null}},"vision":"normal","voluntaryBoosts":{},"voluntaryFlaws":{},"rarity":{"value":"common"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.4.2","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1668802238347,"modifiedTime":1670643761447,"lastModifiedBy":"rbAxRrlSdHM65IFE"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"vVBkRn7sTCpUhdHE":3}}
